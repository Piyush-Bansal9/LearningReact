# Routing and Single Page Applications 

## Routes
Routes are added using react-router-dom library by importing the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route tags.

## Navigation mechanism

- Just adding the routes doesnt make the application single page application we also need to create a navigation mechanism between the routes
- Link is a component that enable us to navigate when clicked.  similar to <a></a> tag with to attribute instead of href attribute.
- useNavigate is a hook which can be used to switch tabs/routes based on some custom logic. For example, we might want a window to be changed after say 10 secs.
